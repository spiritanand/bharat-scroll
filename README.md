# The Bharat Scroll

This project is a tribute to the rich history of Bharat. It represents the History of Bharat in a chronological order. I have used 
the **Wikipedia API** to get the articles of different time periods of Bharatiya history.

## Tech Stack Used

- HTML, CSS, JS (with jquery) for frontend,
- Node.js and Express for running the server and making API calls (backend) and 
- Wikipedia API to get data and images for the articles. Data is taken from the API then formatted. It is fetched from
[here](https://bharat-scroll-production.up.railway.app/data_results) to be used on my frontend.
